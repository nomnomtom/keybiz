# KEYBIZ
End2End Encryption for e-Mail has posed a problem for ages. Various projects
currently attempt to solve it. Among these are TES (trusted email services,
https://blog.open-xchange.com/2015/02/26/trusted-email-services/ and the BMBF
financed enzevalos project (https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/groups/ag-si/enzevalos.html). 

The key-idea of all these projects is, that each domain owner should run a
key-server for his or her own domain, containing keys for all users at that
domain. Keybiz is a small piece of software that allows individuals, 
companies---everyone owning and/or controlling a domain to have users upload 
their keys to a key-server in a verified manner. It integrates with an LDAP
backend, so it should be compatible with Microsoft Exchange and ActiveDirectory.
Keybiz and related software can be setup without requirering changes to the
existing mail setup. For compliance, one just needs to create a set of DNS 
records (and ideally DNSSEC sign ones domain).

## What is Keybiz

Keybiz allows you to upload your public GnuPG keys in a web interface and signs all uids that are known through an authentication back end. The signed key will be uploaded to a key server. 


# Keyserver/DNS Setup

## Keyserver
From you distribution, install SKS, a slim keyserver. Configure it as follows:
```
# use your FQDN here
hostname: sks.example.org

# we do not want to share keys with other servers
recon_address: 127.0.0.1
recon_port: 11370

# key exchange protocol binding to localhost, so we can set up a proxy preventing
# key uploads
hkp_address: 127.0.0.1
hkp_port: 11371
```

## HTTP key-proxy
While access to the keyserver for Keybiz will be via localhost, we still need
a proxy that does SSL and prevents uploading of keys from unknown sources.
This example uses apache for that. If Keybiz is supposed to run on the same
server, you will have to either use apache for it as well, or use nginx for
reverseproxying requests.

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName fqdn

  ## Vhost docroot
  DocumentRoot /var/www



  ## Directories, there should at least be a declaration for /var/www

  ## Load additional static includes


  ## Logging
  ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/fqdn_error_ssl.log
  ServerSignature Off
  CustomLog /var/log/httpd/fqdn_access_ssl.log combined

  ## Proxy rules
  ProxyRequests Off

  ProxyPass / http://localhost:11371/
  
  <Location />
    ProxyPassReverse /
  </Location>
  


  ## Rewrite rules
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(POST)
  RewriteRule .* - [F]

  ## SSL directives
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/own/cert/fqdn.pem
  SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/ssl/own/key/fqdn.pem
  SSLCACertificatePath    /etc/pki/tls/certs
  SSLProtocol             All -SSLv2 -SSLv3
</VirtualHost>

```

## DNS Setup

The required TLSA Record:
```
_443._tcp.HOST.DOMAIN.TLD. 86400 IN      TLSA    3 0 1 60E3DA034077DD2B8ACA6AEFC472A34300A4C4B1E4881B5F83373B4F 508EBB4A

```

The required SRV records:
```
_pgpkey-https._tcp.DOMAIN.TLD. 86400 IN  SRV     10 10 443 HOST.DOMAIN.TLD.
_hkps._tcp.DOMAIN.TLD.   86400   IN      SRV     10 10 443 HOST.DOMAIN.TLD.
```

# Keybiz Installation

Keybiz runs as a web application and requires a web server with wsgi capabilities (e.g. apache2). For installation instructions regarding wsgi applications with your web server refer to their read me documents.

Since keybiz deals with sensitive data, an enforced encrypted HTTP connection is recommended.

## Required Packages

You need a LDAP server, a web server and a data base.
### From your package manager

* ``python`` >= 2.7
* ``python-dev``
* ``libldap2-dev``
* ``gnupg`` >= 1.2.2rc1

### From pip
* ``django``
* ``python-ldap``
* ``django_auth_ldap``

## Webserver Setup

See <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/>. The following is an example nginx configuration. Install nginx (e.g. ``apt install -y nginx``) and uwsgi with pip (e.g. ``pip install uwsgi``). You'll also need a SSL certificate chain for HTTPS connections.

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name sks.example.com keys.example.com;
    location /keycheck {
        include         uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass      localhost:45555;
    }
    location / {
        return 301 /keycheck;
    }

}
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name sks.example.com keys.example.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/sks.example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/sks.example.com.key;
    location /accounts {
        include         uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass      localhost:45555;
    }
    location /keycheck {
        include         uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass      localhost:45555;
    }
    location /admin {
        include         uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass      localhost:45555;
    }
    location / {
        return 301 /keycheck;
    }
}
```

This configuration assumes keybiz will redirect any unencrypted communication from either <http://sks.example.com> or <http://keys.example.com> to their https counter parts. This is enabled by default in ``settings.py``. It also assumes a running uwsgi server on port 45555. An example matching uwsgi configuration (e.g. ``/etc/uwsgi/keybiz.cnf``) follows:

```
[uwsgi]
chdir=/opt/keybiz/
module=keybiz.wsgi:application
master=True
env DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=keybiz.settings
pidfile=/tmp/keybiz.pid
vacuum=True
max-requests=5000
daemonize=/var/log/uwsgi/keybiz.log
socket=127.0.0.1:45555
processes=5
```

This configuration assumes KeyBiz is installed in /opt/keybiz/. See the uwsgi documentation for further configuration options. Add ``uwsgi --ini /etc/uwsgi/keybiz.cnf`` to your ``/etc/rc.local`` to start the uwsgi server at boot. Run that command, to start the server without rebooting. To restart, run ``uwsgi --reload /tmp/keybiz.pid``. You need to restart after each configuration change.

After starting nginx, you should now be able to see the KeyBiz home page in your web browser. If you see an error message, you may need to set up a data base.

### DB Setup
A wide range of databases are supported. As KeyBiz will probably not cause heavy load on your database backend, no special considerations need to be made. KeyBiz supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and SQLite. For installation instructions please refer to <https://docs.djangoproject.com/ja/1.9/ref/databases/>.

The easiest is a SQLite data base. For more complex cases, a PostgreSQL setup will be outlined.

First, you have to install postgresql with your package manager. Also, you have to install the python binding with pip, e.g. ``pip install psycopg2``. After that, you have to set up a data base for KeyBiz and adjust the ``settings.py``.

To set up a data base called keybiz, run the following comands

```
sudo su - postgres
createdb keybiz
createuser -P keybiz
```

...and answer all promts.

```
psql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE keybiz TO keybiz;
```

This allows the newly created user to actually use the data base. Now adjust the data base settings in ``settings.py``

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'keybiz',
        'USER': 'keybiz',
        'PASSWORD': 'supersecretpassword (but not this one)',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
```

leave ``PORT`` empty for default.

Now you need to sync KeyBiz with the data base like so

```
python /opt/keybiz/manage.py migrate
```

### GPG Setup

For signing, a secret key without password is required. This key has to be the standard signing key. Keybiz supports a separate key ring for its operations.

### LDAP Settings
The ``settings.py`` requires additional settings for LDAP. The following is an example configuration that tries find the user without bind:

```
import ldap
from django_auth_ldap.config import LDAPSearch

AUTH_LDAP_SERVER_URI = "ldapi:///"
AUTH_LDAP_BIND_DN = ""
AUTH_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD = ""
AUTH_LDAP_USER_SEARCH = LDAPSearch("ou=users,dc=gytha,dc=dn", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "(uid=%(user)s)")
```
Make sure you enter the correct base for the user tree

Additionally, the LDAP auth back end is required:

```
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'django_auth_ldap.backend.LDAPBackend',
)
```

Note that keybiz *will not work* with other authentication backends. Please make sure you have your users authenticated according to common gpg signing practices before allowing them access to keybiz.

### GPG Settings

For GPG, additional settings are required in ``settings.py``.

``GPG_BIN='/usr/bin/gpg'``
Path to your GnuPG binary

``GPG_KEYRING_FILE='/var/run/django/mykeyring``
Optional key ring file, comment out to use standard key ring

``GPG_KEYSERVER='hkp://keys.gnupg.net'``
Optional key server, comment out to use standard key server
